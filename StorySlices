1. Create VLC playlist and use VLC's random command interface
2. We cd into the Music folder, randomly select a file, then run cvlc <filename>
  ***Make sure the quit after playlist option is selected

For randomizer: (2 functions - Random number generator and file name generator)
1. Read filenames in Music directory
2. Turn this into an array
3. Randomly generate a number between 0 and the last index of the array (inclusive)
4. Function will return the name of the file
5. This name will use interpolation to chart the path in the subprocess call.

For May 14: Report back on how bluetooth works (binding vs accept vs listen vs connect)
Services & Gatt - what are the pieces of a bluetooth connection & device?

Goal: when the button is detected, Pi should connect to the device and be able print out a statement
when button is pressed.

Button should be connected alongside the bluetooth speaker.

Require pygame 2.0.0.dev6 (requires libsdl2-mixer 2.0.0) 
you may have to run sudo apt-get install git curl libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-2.0-0

Address for Muzen Button: F4:4E:FD:43:77:CC

If the speaker doesn't autoconnect:

bluetoothctl
**inside bluetoothctl**
pair F4:4E:FD:43:77:CC
trust F4:4E:FD:43:77:CC
connect F4:4E:FD:43:77:CC

This will reconnect/trust Muzen button. Speaker icon should blue

Steps: 

when the pi starts (this file should run from root cron)

Make sure button and speaker are on (user)
connect to button and speaker
run CovidPlayer

***make sure this can run without monitor***

We either need to enforce a version of pygame to run in the file (on start up_ or figure out why the startup script would even run pygame 1.9.4
