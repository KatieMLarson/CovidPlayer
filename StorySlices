1. Create VLC playlist and use VLC's random command interface
2. We cd into the Music folder, randomly select a file, then run cvlc <filename>
  ***Make sure the quit after playlist option is selected

For randomizer: (2 functions - Random number generator and file name generator)
1. Read filenames in Music directory
2. Turn this into an array
3. Randomly generate a number between 0 and the last index of the array (inclusive)
4. Function will return the name of the file
5. This name will use interpolation to chart the path in the subprocess call.
